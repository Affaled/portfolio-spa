          At the moment, I'm just a beginner developer. I started developing my first "code" when I was 14 years old, but I acknowledge that the experience of creating mods for a game that had its own  language doesn't count for much. Nonetheless, for me, the feeling of creating something within such a unique universe using just a few words was wonderful and motivated me to study more about  programming. I started my studies with Python, but as I've never been able to focus on something for very long, more than five years passed and I never finished that course.

          A few years ago, I met a very interesting guy who motivated me to program again and take it seriously, planning projects with me and always recommending courses. Thanks to him, I started creating game prototypes with GML in Game Maker Studio 2. Recently, he encouraged me to start web development and, talking to him, I realized how important that would be for my development and journey in the job market. Although I'll never be able to abandon games - after all, I've been fascinated by them since I was a kid and have always dreamed of creating my own game - I decided to take a break to dedicate myself to web development. The incredible feeling of being able to create something remains, just in a different universe.
